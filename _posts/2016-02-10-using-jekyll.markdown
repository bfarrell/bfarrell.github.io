As I just walked though a quick tutorial, I thought I would share a bit about my finding on creating a blog using [Jekyll][jekyll].  Overall, it was very easy and allows creation of a blog within a few minutes.

# Steps
I am working on OSX but this could easilly be done in another OS.

*	Install or verify that ruby is installed
	*	ruby --version
	*	Verify that your ruby version >= 2.0.0
*	Install jekyll
	*	gem install jekyll
*	Create a new github project under your user
	*	Go to Github
	*	Create a repository called \<github_user\>.github.io
*	Clone it on your system
	*	git clone https://github.com/\<github_user\>/\<github_user\>.github.io.git
*	Generate a jekyll site
	*	jekyll new \<github_user\>.github.io
*	Run your site
	*	cd \<github_user\>/github.io
	*	jekyll server
	*	Goto http://127.0.0.1:4000
*	Personalize your site
	*	Update _config.yml with your site name, twitter user, github user, etc
*	Create blog posts
	*	cd _posts
	*	Create a new file with the format YYYY-MM-DD-\<topic\>.markdown
	*	Edit the file and add your content using markdown format
*	Profit?

Hope this was informative.  Look for more posts to come.
